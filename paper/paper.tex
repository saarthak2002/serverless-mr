\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MapReduce is a scalable computation model that allows batch processing of enormous datasets. Serverless computing is a cloud programming paradigm in which software can be deployed with resources allocated on-demand without the need to manage server infrastructure. We wanted to bring these two models together and create a Serverless MapReduce implementation that provides the advantages of both worlds, like cost-effectiveness and parallelism. We used AWS Lambda to invoke cloud functions that perform map or reduce tasks and AWS S3 as a distributed object store for inputs, outputs, and intermediate data.

[\textbf{TODO}: Abstract will be modified later with testing methodologies, results, and conclusions; our main goal for the checkpoint was to get our MapReduce implementation up and running.]
